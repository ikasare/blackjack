### Game Rules 

- Players are to get a higher score or total than the dealer without going  above a score of 21.
- The dealer deals one card to the player then to himself. The player but not the dealer gets a second card. 
- The player decides to stick with the total they have or hit(get another card). A player can hit as many times as they like 
but as soon as their total goes above 21 they bust and the dealer wins.
- The cards a player holds when they stick is called their hand. 
- Once the player sticks, the dealer then gets a second card and decides to stick or hit. This works the same as for players.
- The dealer however cannot stick on less than 17.
- Once the dealer is done if the player has a higher total than him then he loses and the player wins.
- The ace can have both values of 1 and 11 and the player decides which to use so they get the best total from their hand.
- It's a draw if score is the same.
